This repo creates two sample policies, attach them to a compliance standard and create an alert rule attached to it.
This is updated on a best-effort basis, and should be considered as an example for inspiration of using the Prisma terraform provider. 

If adding more policies to the Policy.tf file, they also needs to be referenced in the AlertRule.tf to get continuous scanning activated. 
This is done under the: policies = tolist
We need to reference the newely created policy ID from the resource in Policy.tf file.

The provider.tf are not configured, and assumes that the following ENV variables are configured in the environment:
PRISMACLOUD_URL=
PRISMACLOUD_USERNAME=
PRISMACLOUD_PASSWORD=
PRISMACLOUD_CUSTOMER_NAME=

Update the terraform.tfvars with your relevant configuration;
accountIds = ["YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"]
emailRecipients = ["YOUR_EMAIL"]
